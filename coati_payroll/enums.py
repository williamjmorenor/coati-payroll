"""Enumerations for type safety using Python 3.11+ StrEnum.

This module defines string-based enums using Python 3.11's StrEnum class,
which provides better type safety and autocompletion compared to plain strings.

StrEnum was introduced in Python 3.11 and automatically generates string values
from member names when values aren't explicitly provided.
