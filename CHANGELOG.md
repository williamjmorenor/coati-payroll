## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Added payroll comparison flow with a dedicated route, comparison dashboard template, and a "Comparar con otra nómina" action from payroll detail.
- Added `NominaComparacion` model persistence for cached base-vs-actual comparison results, including freshness and approval metadata.
- Added `NominaComparisonService` with KPI generation for alerts, outliers, concept drivers, segmentation, structural changes, stability score, and vacation-rule comparisons.
- Added comparison-oriented indexes on `NominaEmpleado (nomina_id, empleado_id)` and `NominaDetalle (nomina_empleado_id, tipo, codigo)`.

### Changed

- Updated payroll recalculation flow to refresh/re-point comparison cache rows that referenced the replaced payroll id.
- Exposed `NominaComparisonService` through the planilla services package exports.

### Fixed

- Added race-safe comparison cache persistence by handling concurrent insert `IntegrityError` with rollback and cached-row re-read fallback.

### Tests

- Added unit tests for comparison KPI/statistical helpers, approval metadata helpers, and concurrent cache insert fallback handling.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- Moved base salary accounting configuration to company-level (`Empresa`) and exposed debit/credit account + description fields in company maintenance UI.
- Updated accounting voucher generation to resolve base salary accounts with company-first priority and planilla fallback for backward compatibility.
- Updated accounting configuration validation warnings to report missing base salary setup based on the effective source (empresa/planilla).
- Updated salary-payable usage in loan/advance accounting lines to reuse the same resolved base salary credit account.

### Added

- Added documentation for robust summarized voucher setup, including source-of-truth matrix for salario básico, percepciones, deducciones, prestaciones, and paid-vacation accrual liability.
- Edit html forms.
- Updated payroll novelties concept selectors to use only active concepts assigned to the payroll template (`Planilla`).
- Updated novelties deduction selector to exclude deduction types `tax` and `social_security`.

### Tests

- Added coverage for novelties selector filtering by planilla assignment, active state, and deduction type exclusion (`tax` / `social_security`).

## [1.7.3] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- Replaced mid-year carry-in bootstrap strategy from employee-level implementation fields to company-level configuration using `primer_mes_nomina` and `primer_anio_nomina`.
- Added bootstrap period fields to company management forms and company edit views.
- Added server-side lock for company bootstrap period fields when payroll runs already exist in `applied` or `paid` status.
- Updated payroll calculation flow so employee carry-in values are applied only when `periodo_inicio` matches the company's configured first payroll period.
- Updated accumulation bootstrap to derive `periodos_procesados` from fiscal start month and payroll periodicity (`periodos_por_anio`) without hardcoded assumptions.
- Added an initial implementation helper at `/settings/helpers/` to import summarized accounting voucher account mappings from an Excel template using user-visible names (not internal database IDs) for companies, earnings, deductions, benefits, and vacation policies.

### Fixed

- Fixed carry-in behavior to avoid reapplying employee bootstrap balances outside the configured initial company period.
- Fixed company form rendering to support disabled fields in `render_field` macro, ensuring lock UX works correctly.

### Documentation

- Updated employer docs to describe company-level bootstrap configuration and lock behavior.
- Updated employee docs to remove legacy implementation year/month fields and keep only carry-in balances.
- Clarified that implementation period is not configured in global calculation settings.

### Tests

- Updated repository tests for company-level bootstrap behavior and derived initial period counts.
- Added company view test coverage for bootstrap field lock when payroll is already applied.


## [1.7.2] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- Improved annual accumulation bootstrap logic for mid-year payroll implementations by applying employee-provided initial balances only during the configured implementation fiscal year.
- Added explicit implementer guidance for fiscal mid-year cutovers with accumulated salary and retained income tax balances.

### Fixed

- Fixed IR carry-in initialization so `impuesto_acumulado` is now mapped to `impuesto_retenido_acumulado` (retained tax), not to pre-tax deductions.
- Fixed initial processed-period bootstrap for fiscal calculations by deriving `periodos_procesados` from `mes_ultimo_cierre` during implementation cutovers.

### Tests

- Added repository-level tests to validate mid-year bootstrap balances and prevent reapplying initial carry-in values in subsequent fiscal years.


## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- Regenerated audit vouchers during payroll apply after prestaciones/vacation side effects, ensuring persisted accounting lines include paid vacation liability for detailed voucher exports.
- Made `aplicar_nomina` transactional around side effects and voucher regeneration so failures roll back the apply operation and avoid partial persistence.
- Reused a shared voucher-regeneration helper in the manual regeneration route to keep calculation date/user behavior consistent.
- Updated payroll Excel export (`exportar-excel`) to a dynamic 5-section layout with extended header metadata, generic reclassification handling, and vacation liability in labor benefits.

### Tests

- Added route-level coverage to verify payroll apply persists a voucher and rolls back correctly when voucher regeneration fails.
- Updated vacation accrual end-to-end validation to assert `vacation_liability` lines are available from persisted detailed voucher data after applying payroll, without manual regeneration.


## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Docker deployment architecture**: Added `PROCESS_ROLE` environment variable to support three deployment options:
  - `PROCESS_ROLE=web`: Web-only container (no worker) for separate web/worker deployments
  - `PROCESS_ROLE=worker`: Dedicated Dramatiq worker container
  - `PROCESS_ROLE=all`: All-in-one container with app + worker (default, backward compatible)
- **Systemd deployment**: Added example unit files for production systemd deployments:
  - `systemd/coati-payroll.service`: Web application service
  - `systemd/coati-payroll-worker.service`: Dedicated Dramatiq worker service
  - `systemd/README.md`: Complete installation and configuration guide
- Comprehensive deployment documentation in README.md covering:
  - Option 1: Single container without queue processing (development)
  - Option 2: All-in-one container with background processing (small/medium deployments)
  - Option 3: Separate web/worker containers with Redis (production, scalable)

### Changed

- Restricted payroll background processing to Dramatiq+Redis only; removed operational fallback to Huey.
- Updated queue and background payroll documentation to reflect Dramatiq+Redis as the only supported background backend and Noop degradation when Redis is unavailable.
- Removed `huey` from runtime dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Removed legacy `coati_payroll/queue/drivers/huey_driver.py` and remaining runtime references to Huey.
- Refactored `docker-entrypoint.sh` to support role-based container startup with proper database initialization only for web/all roles.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

- Deferred prestaciones (`PrestacionAcumulada`) ledger side effects to the payroll apply step (`applied`/`paid`) so draft/generated recalculations do not mutate balances.

### Fixed

- Added defensive cleanup for legacy `PrestacionAcumulada` rows tied to recalculated source payrolls to avoid duplicate benefit balances.

### Tests

- Updated unit and validation tests to assert prestaciones ledger updates only happen on payroll apply/paid transitions and remain idempotent across draft recalculations.


## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- Added `mes_inicio_fiscal` to `Planilla` and exposed it in the payroll template form as a month selector (January-December).
- Added `prorate_by_period_days` to `VacationPolicy` to control period-day proration for periodic accruals.

### Changed

- Updated payroll template create/edit/clone flows to persist and propagate `mes_inicio_fiscal`.
- Updated fiscal-period resolution in payroll accumulation and annual lookup logic to use `Planilla.mes_inicio_fiscal` as the source of truth.
- Updated monthly fiscal progression inputs used by calculation rules to align with the planilla fiscal-start month.
- Deferred vacation ledger side effects to the payroll apply step to avoid mutating balances during generation.
- Rounded vacation ledger accruals to 2 decimal places for balance consistency.
- Updated Nicaragua default vacation policy to accrue full monthly rate regardless of month length.

### Fixed

- Allowed recalculating non-approved payrolls for the same period by excluding the source payroll from overlap and duplicate-period validation checks.
- Fixed periodic vacation accrual proration so monthly policies on biweekly payrolls accrue proportionally by worked days in the period.
- Fixed calculation rules issues.
- Cleaned vacation ledger entries tied to recalculated payrolls to prevent duplicate accruals and recomputed balances.


## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- Hardened deletion safeguards: companies cannot be deleted when they have active employee links or associated payroll runs, and payroll templates (`Planilla`) cannot be deleted when they have associated payruns (`Nomina`).

### Fixed

- Fixed missing CSRF tokens in 49+ POST forms across 23 templates to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
- Fixed schema initialization in `flask database init` by resolving a duplicate index name collision on `liquidacion.concepto_id` that could leave tables like `vacation_account` uncreated.
- Fixed vacation policy form validation so `Tasa de Acumulación` and `Días Mínimos de Servicio` are now optional and default to `0` when omitted.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Added configurable payment percentage for paid vacations via `porcentaje_pago_vacaciones` field in `VacationPolicy` (default 100%).
- Added `son_vacaciones_pagadas` flag to `VacationPolicy` to mark policies that should generate accounting liability entries.
- Added accounting configuration fields to `VacationPolicy`: `cuenta_debito_vacaciones_pagadas`, `cuenta_credito_vacaciones_pagadas`, and their descriptions.
- Added `vacation_policy_id` foreign key to `Planilla` model to allow explicit binding of payroll to vacation accrual policy.
- Extended `VacationService` to prioritize planilla-bound vacation policy when resolving employee vacation accounts.
- Extended `AccountingVoucherService` to generate vacation liability accounting lines for paid vacation policies during payroll execution.

### Changed

- Vacation payment calculation now applies configurable percentage: `monto = (salario_base / dias_base) * units * (porcentaje / 100)`.
- Vacation approval workflow now only validates balance; actual balance deduction deferred to payroll execution via `NominaNovedad` for better traceability.
- Planilla creation/edit forms now include vacation policy selector with scope-aware choices (planilla/empresa/global).

### Fixed

- Fixed SQLAlchemy "multiple foreign key paths" error in bidirectional `Planilla`-`VacationPolicy` relationship by specifying explicit `foreign_keys` parameter.
- Fixed Alembic migration compatibility with SQLite by using `op.batch_alter_table()` for foreign key operations instead of direct `op.create_foreign_key()` and `op.drop_constraint()`.

- Preserved date/string inputs without Decimal conversion in initial variable preparation and step storage.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- Added concept-level absence defaults to `Percepcion` and `Deduccion` via `es_inasistencia` and `descontar_pago_inasistencia`.
- Updated payroll concept forms and shared concept UI to configure these absence-default flags.
- Updated concept persistence/audit change detection to store and track the new absence-default flags.
- Updated novelty backend creation/update to apply defaults from the selected concept when absence flags are omitted, while preserving explicit payload values.
- Applied the same absence-default resolution to vacation-generated novelties and demo novelty creation for consistent behavior across entry points.
- Added route-level tests for novelty creation to validate default propagation and explicit override behavior.
- Refactored novelty absence-default resolution into a shared utility module to simplify reuse and enable isolated unit testing.
- Added focused unit tests for absence-default resolution and explicit-form override behavior without requiring full view/bootstrap fixtures.

### Changed

- Added absence flags to novelties and applied unpaid-absence salary discounts with a distinct `salario_neto_inasistencia` formula input.
- Standardized the disability novelty concept code to `DISABILITY` for formula sources.
- Updated accounting voucher generation to honor inverted debit/credit configuration for applicable perceptions and deductions.

### Fixed

- Fixed vacation approvals to validate balances, deduct immediately, and log ledger entries consistently.


## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- Refactored modules across CLI, queue drivers, payroll processing, and view layers to align with the active lint/type validation baseline.
- Standardized control-flow patterns, SQLAlchemy boolean predicates, import organization, and variable naming to reduce static-analysis false positives.
- Updated `pylint` configuration with explicit non-critical exclusions used by this codebase and its framework integration points.

### CI

- Added `pylint -j 0 coati_payroll` to `.github/workflows/python-package.yml`.
- Added `dev/lint.sh` to run the full local validation stack (`black`, `ruff`, `flake8`, `pylint`, `mypy`, `pytest`, and `pytest -m validation`).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-08

### Changed

- Marked the codebase as `mypy` compliant for the `coati_payroll` package under the current type-checking configuration.
- Integrated `mypy` execution into the CI workflow to enforce type checks on every push and pull request.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- Preserved `NominaNovedad` records during payroll recalculation to prevent loss of payroll master data.
- Re-linked preserved novelties to the new recalculated payroll run instead of deleting them with old calculation records.
- Added defensive regression tests to ensure novelties are not deleted in future recalculation changes.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- Corrected an error in payrun calculation.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-07
